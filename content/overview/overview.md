# Overview of Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph exposes multiple APIs from Office 365 and other Microsoft cloud services through a single endpoint:  **https://graph.microsoft.com**. Using the Microsoft Graph, you can turn formerly difficult or complex queries into simple navigations. 
 
You can use Microsoft Graph to:

- Access data from multiple Microsoft cloud services, including: Azure Active Directory, Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, OneNote, Planner and more.
- Navigate between entities and relationships.
- Access intelligence and insights from the Microsoft cloud (for commercial users).
